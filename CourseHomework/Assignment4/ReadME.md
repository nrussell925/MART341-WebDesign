## How Web Browsers Function  
Web browsers retrieve, interpret, and display web content. When a user enters a URL, the browser sends an HTTP request to a web server, which responds with the requested HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The browser processes these files, constructs the DOM (Document Object Model), applies styles, executes scripts, and renders the final webpage on the screen.

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and How Does It Power Your Web Pages?  
The DOM is a tree-like representation of a webpage. It allows JavaScript to dynamically modify content, styles, and structure. When a webpage loads, the browser parses the HTML to create the DOM, enabling interactive and dynamic user experiences.

## What Are the Four Essential Elements Every HTML Page Needs?  
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` – Declares the document type and ensures proper rendering in browsers.  
2. `<html>` – The root element that contains all other HTML elements.  
3. `<head>` – Includes metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts.  
4. `<body>` – Contains the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and interactive elements.
