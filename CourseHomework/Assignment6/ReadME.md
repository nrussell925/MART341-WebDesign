## Portfolio

I have chosen to develope the portfolio idea further. I chose this because I would like to design a portfolio website to have for future employers. I currently already have a portfolio on GitHub but I made it using Bootstrap.

## Reflection

The background color that I chose contrast with the white container adding depth to my website, while having a basic layout. The width I chose ensures the content is centered and that it looks good on different screen sizes.

I definitely am going to work on this website more to make it look more professional but I think it is mostly what I had in mind for a start on a portfolio website.

I didn't really experiment with the margin but I messeed with it to make sure my content is centered on the page.

Initially when I added the list the bullets were on the far left of the page and the elements were in the center. I solved this by adding the ".skills-list" and aligning the text to the left.

I'm doing good in class so far, I have taken a few classes involving html and css so it hasn't been too challenging yet.
