#MART 341

####Nikolas Russell


So far, the class is going well. It took me a second to figure out some of the stuff on **Github**; even though I'm a *CS major*, I'm still not the best at using it. The semester is also going pretty well for me. So far, I like all of my classes.



The classes I am taking:

- MART341
- CALC 3
- Computer Architecture
- Art and Science of Interactive Games
- Sports Analytics
- Wildland Fuel Management
