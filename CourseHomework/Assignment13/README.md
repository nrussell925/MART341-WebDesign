# Assignment 13 - Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a 4-page professional portfolio website for an imaginary client (Nik Russell).

## Techniques Used

- **At Least 4 Pages**: `index.html`, `projects.html`, `skills.html`, `contact.html`
- **Responsive Design**: Website adjusts smoothly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Used in `style.css` to modify layout for devices under 768px width.
- **Navigation Menu**: Present at the top of every page, linking all pages.
- **Dropdown Menu**: "Projects" menu includes dropdown links to Web Projects and Other Projects.

## How Techniques Were Applied

- **Pages**: Each page has unique content but shares a consistent layout and design.
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox is used for the navigation layout; hero images and text resize based on screen width.
- **Media Queries**: Layout switches from horizontal nav to stacked nav on smaller screens.
- **Navigation Menu**: Clear, simple, and accessible across all pages.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Smooth, user-friendly dropdown for project categories.
