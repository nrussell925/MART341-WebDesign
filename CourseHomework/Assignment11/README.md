# Avalanche 1 Workshop â€“ Assignment 11

This project showcases a webpage for an Avalanche Level 1 safety workshop. Below are the required techniques and how they were applied.

## Required Techniques

- **External CSS Style Sheet**  
  The `styles.css` file is linked externally to keep structure and style separate.

- **Hover Effects**  
  Used on navigation links and buttons for interactivity.

- **Self-Hosted Font**  
  The Montserrat font is self-hosted in the `fonts/` directory and applied to section headings.

- **Font from a Font Library**  
  Google Font "Open Sans" is used for body text for easy readability.

## Additional Techniques

1. **Font Styles**  
   Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body text to visually separate content.

2. **Font Weight**  
   Heavier font weights emphasize key info like dates and section titles.

3. **Text Decoration**  
   Used underline on links and styled hover states to remove underline on hover.

4. **Text Alignment**  
   Centered title, left-aligned content for a clean layout.

5. **Pseudo-Classes**  
   Styled `:hover` and `:first-child` selectors for interactivity and layout consistency.
