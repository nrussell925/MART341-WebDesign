# Class I truly enjoyed

One class that I truly enjoy currently is Wildland Fuel Management. I'm a wildland firefighter in the summers so what we learn in that class ties directly in with my current job. This makes it a lot easier to focus in the class because it's stuff that I already partially know about and can actually apply to my current job.
