# Personal Budget Tracker - README

## 1. Peer Review Reflection
- **How did the peer review go for the discussion?**
    - The peer review went good.
- **Was it easier to remember to post and reply with this format?**
    - Yes, it was easier for me to post and reply personally. This is how other classes I've taken does the discussion posts. I did get used to posting on Friday's though, it was just early in the semester when I would forget but adding a due date on Friday helped me remember.
- **Can I help out with anything specific?**
    - I don't think so.

## 2. README List

- **Designated Page**: This week, I am working on the `index.html` page, which is a simple **Personal Budget Tracker** page that allows users to input their total income and expenses.

## 3. Required Techniques (Must Have)
- **External CSS Style Sheet**:
    - I have created an external CSS file (`styles.css`) that styles the HTML page. The external stylesheet is linked to the HTML page in the `<head>` section of the code using the `<link>` tag.
  
- **Class and ID Selectors**:
    - I used **class selectors** for sections like `.overview`, `.progress`, and `.summary` to define common styles for those elements.
    - **ID selectors** were used for specific elements such as `#income-display`, `#expenses-display`, and `#remaining-display`, where I would later add functionality to update the budget information.

## 4. Selected Additional Techniques
- **Background Colors**:
    - The page uses background colors for the main sections and the progress bar container to give it a more visually appealing layout. I used contrasting background colors to differentiate sections.
  
- **Text Color**:
    - The text color is chosen to ensure good contrast for readability, especially considering accessibility for users with visual impairments. Headings are styled with darker colors to emphasize them.
  
- **Positioning**:
    - I used CSS positioning to align sections and elements (e.g., the progress bar is centered within its container). Margins and padding were applied to give each section enough space for clarity.

- **Opacity**:
    - The progress bar uses a slight opacity to give it a more polished, semi-transparent effect, making the page look more modern.

- **Borders**:
    - I applied borders to certain elements (e.g., around the input fields) to create visual separation and structure the layout more clearly.

## 5. Future Plans for Dynamic Functionality
- **JavaScript Implementation**:
    - This page is currently static, I plan to implement JavaScript functionality in the future. This will allow the page to dynamically calculate the remaining budget and update the progress bar based on user input.

## 6. Design Notes
- **Color Palette**:
    - I chose a simple, clean color palette for the layout. The primary background color is a soft shade of gray to keep the focus on the content. Sections are divided using contrasting colors to help users easily navigate through the page.
  
- **Spacing and Layout**:
    - Spacing between sections and elements is carefully controlled to avoid clutter and maintain a clean, organized look. The layout ensures that all sections are easy to read and interact with, even without dynamic behavior.
  
- **Accessibility**:
    - Text color and contrast have been considered to ensure that users with color blindness or poor vision can easily read the content. Labels are also used to describe the input fields, improving accessibility for screen readers.
