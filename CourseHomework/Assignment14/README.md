## Techniques Applied

### 1. 3+ Pages with Cohesive Theme
This site includes five HTML pages:
- `index.html` – Home
- `projects.html` – Projects
- `skills.html` – Skills
- `contact.html` – Contact
- `test.html` – Test/demo page

Each shares a consistent navigation bar, layout, and color scheme using a shared CSS file and Bootstrap.

---

### 2. CSS Framework Integration
- **Bootstrap 5** was added to `test.html`.
- Used for:
  - Layout and spacing (`container`, `my-5`)
  - Styled buttons (`btn btn-primary`)
  - Responsive navbar (`nav`, `nav-item`)

---

### 3. Framework Styling Elements
- Bootstrap used to streamline layout and ensure responsiveness.
- Makes the site mobile-friendly with minimal custom code.

---

### 4. HTML5 Canvas
- `test.html` contains a canvas that draws and animates a bouncing ball.
- Used `<canvas>` and the 2D rendering context to build interactive visuals.

---

### 5. JavaScript Functionality
- The `script.js` file includes:
  - A real-time bouncing ball animation
  - DOM interaction (button starts the animation)
  - Canvas drawing with movement and edge detection

---

## Reflection
This assignment was a great opportunity to experiment with HTML5 canvas, JS animation, and modern frameworks like Bootstrap. I reused my personal website as the base and added dynamic features to make it more interactive.
