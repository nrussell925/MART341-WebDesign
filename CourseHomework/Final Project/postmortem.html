      <h2>What I Built</h2>
      <p>This website promotes an Avalanche Level 1 Workshop for backcountry travelers. It provides basic course info, a schedule, and registration links. The site is styled with custom fonts, includes a dropdown menu, and uses a clear, mobile-friendly layout.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>Over the semester, I gained confidence using HTML and CSS to structure and style content. I learned how to build dropdown menus, apply responsive design principles, and work with Google Fonts. I also got better at organizing code and thinking about user experience.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>One challenge was building a clean navigation system that looked good and worked on mobile. I also had to troubleshoot some layout bugs with spacing and alignment, which taught me more about CSS display properties and flexbox behavior.</p>

      <h2>What I’d Do Differently</h2>
      <p>If I had more time, I’d add some interactivity with JavaScript — maybe a dynamic schedule, or a form that validates user input. I’d also explore using a CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap to speed up layout and ensure better responsiveness.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This project helped me understand the fundamentals of building and publishing a basic web presence. I’m proud of the result and feel more prepared to design and deploy simple websites on my own.</p>
